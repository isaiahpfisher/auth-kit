# Auth Kit
I made this project by following along with [Code with Antonio's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MTyCvS05V4).
- Go to the [live version](https://auth.isaiahpfisher.com).
- It was made with NextAuth (Auth.js) and Next.js and deployed with Vercel.
### Things Learned
I learned a lot more about how to handle authentication by building Auth Kit:
  - Salting passwords.
  - Managing the session.
  - Two factor authentication.
  - Email verification (using Resend).
  - Updating emails.
  - Updating passwords.
  - OAuth providers (Google and Github)
  - Role-based access (front-end and api)
### Technologies
Auth Kit uses the following technologies:
- React and Next.js
- Tailwind (styling)
- MySQL and Neon.tech (database)
- Auth.js (auth)
- Github and Google OAuth
- Resend Email
